- removed %post (adding group "audio" should be done in setup, not in
  dev)
- removed Requires: shadow, sh-utils (not needed if no %post): to remove
  loop in dependencies (dev should require only setup and nothing more)
- changed Requires: setup to Prereq: setup to force right installation
  order.
